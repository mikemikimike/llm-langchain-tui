# llm-tui

Langchain practice: a chat agent behind a Textual TUI, running on any OpenAI-compatible
model endpoint — Ollama locally, or a remote API — on python 3.12.

Dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). After cloning:

```sh
uv sync                    # creates .venv, installs the pinned deps
cp config/config.example.json config/config.json    # app settings
cp config/models.example.json config/models.json    # providers + models
```

## configuration

Both config files are gitignored — the committed `*.example.json` files are the
templates. Paths inside them are relative to the project root and resolved in
`llmtui/config.py`, so scripts run the same from any directory. A bad file fails at
import, naming the offending key.

`config/config.json` — app settings: sqlite/milvus db paths, milvus index options, the
obsidian api key and cert, agent behaviour (`max_tool_calls`, `display_thinking`).

`config/models.json` — providers and models, pi-harness style. Any OpenAI-compatible
endpoint (ollama, llama.cpp server, vLLM, LM Studio, remote apis) is just a JSON entry;
no code changes. Sampling params (`temperature`, `top_k`, ...) are per model and sent
through to the server verbatim. `"$ENV_VAR"` in any string reads from the environment.
`/model` in the TUI switches between entries; the file is re-read every time the picker
opens, so edits land without a restart.

## models and providers

ollama locally: pull models through `ollama run` and point a provider entry at
`http://localhost:11434/v1`. the context meter picks up the model's real context length
from ollama automatically; other servers should declare `contextWindow` on the entry.

remote: entries point at whatever speaks the openai chat-completions dialect. reasoning
models get `reasoning_effort` from their `reasoning` field.

## running it

```sh
uv run python app.py                        # the chat TUI
uv run python scripts/ingest.py <pdf_dir>   # build the vector store
uv run python scripts/inspect_context.py    # dump a thread's context as html
```

slash commands in the TUI: `/help`, `/model`, `/name`, `/load`, `/new`, `/delete`.

## rag / ingest

`ingest.py` builds a hybrid (dense + bm25) milvus index from a directory of PDFs into
the live store at `db/milvus.db`. If a store already exists, it is moved to
`db/backups/` (only the last backup is kept) before the rebuild — no manual copying.
`restore.py` swaps a backup back into place. run this from the root of the project:

embeddings are provider-agnostic too: the `embeddings` section of `config/models.json`
(names a `baseUrl`, `apiKey`, and `model`) — any `/v1/embeddings`-compatible server
works: ollama, TensorX, OpenRouter, e.g. `qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`.
